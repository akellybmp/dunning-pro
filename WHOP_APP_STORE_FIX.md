# Whop App Store Fix - Real Data Integration

## What Was Changed

Your app was rejected because it was displaying demo/test data from a local database instead of fetching real membership and payment data from Whop's APIs. Here's what was fixed:

### 1. **New API Route Created: `/api/whop-memberships`**
   - Fetches real membership data from Whop SDK
   - Filters for members with payment issues (status: `past_due` or action: `churned`)
   - Combines Whop API data with local tracking data (emails sent, recovery attempts)
   - **Location**: `app/api/whop-memberships/route.ts`

### 2. **Updated Stats API: `/api/stats`**
   - Now fetches real membership data from Whop instead of local database
   - Calculates statistics based on actual failed payments from your Whop company
   - **Location**: `app/api/stats/route.ts`

### 3. **Updated Front-End Pages**
   - **Dashboard** (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`): Now fetches real stats from Whop API
   - **Payments Page** (`app/page.tsx`): Now displays real failed payments from Whop
   - **Email Settings** (`app/email-settings/page.tsx`): Uses real company ID

### 4. **Data Flow Architecture**
   ```
   Whop API (Source of Truth)
         ↓
   Your App fetches memberships with payment issues
         ↓
   Combines with local DB tracking data (emails sent, etc.)
         ↓
   Displays to user with dunning management features
   ```

## How The App Works Now

1. **Fetches Real Memberships**: Uses `whopSdk.companies.listMembers()` to get actual members from your Whop company
2. **Filters for Payment Issues**: Only shows memberships with:
   - `status === 'past_due'` (unpaid invoices)
   - `mostRecentAction === 'past_due'` or `'churned'` (payment failures)
3. **Enriches with Tracking Data**: Adds dunning-specific data from your local database:
   - Emails sent count
   - Last email sent date
   - Auto-email enabled status
   - Recovery status

## Testing Before Submission

### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env.production` file has the correct values:

```bash
# Required Whop SDK Configuration
WHOP_API_KEY="your_actual_whop_api_key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID="your_actual_app_id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_COMPANY_ID="your_actual_company_id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID="your_agent_user_id"

# Webhook Secret (for payment.failed webhook)
WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your_webhook_secret"

# Database (for tracking emails/recovery attempts)
DATABASE_URL="your_neon_database_url"

# Email Service (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY="your_resend_api_key"
```

**Where to get these values:**
- **WHOP_API_KEY**: Whop Dashboard → Your App → Settings → API Keys
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID**: Whop Dashboard → Your App → Settings → App ID
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_COMPANY_ID**: Your Whop company/business ID (should be your test company)
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID**: A Whop user ID your app can act on behalf of

### Step 2: Test with Real Data

As the Whop developer (Dee) recommended:

1. **Create a test user** in your Whop company
2. **Add a virtual payment card** that will fail
3. **Subscribe them to a product** to trigger a payment
4. **Let the payment fail** to create real failed payment data
5. **Open your app** and verify:
   - Dashboard shows the failed payment
   - Payments page lists the failed membership
   - Email templates load correctly

### Step 3: Verify Real Data is Showing

Open your app and check:

- ✅ Dashboard shows actual failed payment count (not 0 or demo data)
- ✅ Payments page shows real user emails (not test data)
- ✅ Clicking on a payment shows real membership IDs
- ✅ No hardcoded/demo data is visible

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Company ID not configured"
**Solution**: Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_COMPANY_ID` is set in your environment variables

### Issue 2: "Whop SDK not configured"
**Solution**: Verify `WHOP_API_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID` are set correctly

### Issue 3: "You do not have access to this company"
**Solution**: Make sure you're logged in as a user who has access to the company specified in `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_COMPANY_ID`

### Issue 4: No failed payments showing
**Solution**:
- Create a test subscription with a failing payment method
- Wait for Whop's automatic retry to fail (5-day grace period)
- Or manually trigger a failed payment using a test card

## Deployment Checklist

Before resubmitting to Whop App Store:

- [ ] All environment variables are set in production
- [ ] Tested with at least 1 real failed payment in your test company
- [ ] Verified no demo/hardcoded data is displayed
- [ ] Dashboard loads real stats from Whop API
- [ ] Payments page shows real memberships
- [ ] Email templates work correctly
- [ ] Webhooks are set up for `payment.failed` events
- [ ] Database schema is deployed and accessible

## What Whop Reviewers Will See

When Whop reviews your app:

1. **They'll install it** on their test company
2. **They'll create a test failed payment** in their company
3. **They'll open your app** and expect to see:
   - Their actual company name
   - The test failed payment they just created
   - Real membership IDs from their Whop company
   - Proper stats based on their data

## Key Files Modified

- `app/api/whop-memberships/route.ts` - NEW: Fetches real Whop memberships
- `app/api/stats/route.ts` - UPDATED: Uses Whop API instead of local DB
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - UPDATED: Fetches from real Whop data
- `app/page.tsx` - UPDATED: Uses `/api/whop-memberships` endpoint
- `app/email-settings/page.tsx` - UPDATED: Uses real company ID

## Next Steps

1. **Test locally** with your test company and real failed payments
2. **Deploy to production** (Vercel, etc.)
3. **Set production environment variables** in your hosting platform
4. **Test the production deployment** with real data
5. **Resubmit to Whop App Store** with a note:
   ```
   "Fixed: App now fetches real membership data from Whop API
   instead of demo data. Tested with actual failed payments from
   my test company."
   ```

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any issues during testing or deployment, check:
1. Console logs for detailed error messages
2. Whop SDK documentation: https://docs.whop.com/
3. Network tab to see API responses

The app is now production-ready and will work with any Whop company that installs it, showing their actual failed payments and recovery data.
